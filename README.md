# Python Stuff
So in the 70s and 80 I used Basic as my goto computer language to do something quick and dirty. These days I use Python as my goto language. Most of the time I do not even think of it as a powwrful Object-oriented programming language with massive amounts of librarries. Python is one of the easyest program language to get started in. One of the reasons is that you do not even have to declare what kind of varables the program is using. As an old timer Fortran programmer, I had second thoughts abot this. However, it was quckly realized that you could consentrate on the subject matter on hand.
